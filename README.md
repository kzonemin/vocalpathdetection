Introduction
This repository implements a machine learning solution to detect pathological voice conditions using audio recordings. The system analyzes vocal features and classifies voices into pathological or healthy categories.

Features
Extracts acoustic features such as jitter, shimmer, and MFCCs.
Uses advanced machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Random Forest Classifier (RFC).
Provides insights into vocal health based on audio analysis.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, R
Libraries:
Python: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Librosa, Matplotlib
R: caret, ggplot2
Machine Learning Models: SVM, GMM, RFC
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vocal-pathology-detection.git  
cd vocal-pathology-detection  
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
(Optional) Set up the R environment if using R-based tools.
Usage
Preprocess the dataset:
Ensure the audio files are in the correct format.
Run the preprocessing script to extract features:
bash
Copy code
python extract_features.py  
Train the model:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py  
Test the model:
bash
Copy code
python test_model.py  
Visualize the results:
bash
Copy code
python visualize_results.py  
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of voice recordings from individuals with and without pathological conditions. [Provide details about dataset source or instructions for obtaining it.]

Model Training and Evaluation
The features are extracted from audio files using Librosa.
Training and testing were performed using multiple classifiers.
Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
[Add a summary of your model's performance, including key metrics, graphs, or confusion matrices.]
